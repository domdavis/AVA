# A.V.A.: Auxilliary Voice Assistent

AVA is a [Voice Attack][] Plugin for [Elite Dangerous][] that uses [EDDI][] to handle Events. It's _very_ early doors on the
project, basicaly replicating some stuff I'd done direct with the Voice Attack UI, and providing a foundation to handle and
dispatch the EDDI events. In the future there are plans to combine it with my [CH Products Joystick Map][] and possibly distrubte
a `dll`. For now it's something people can have a play about with, build from source, and tweak into something that might be
useful for them. It's also allowing [forcing? ;) ] me to learn C# so I make no guarantees over how good the code here is.
